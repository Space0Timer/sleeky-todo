# Architecture

The application will use a layered monolith:

```text
React
  -> ASP.NET Core API
  -> Application commands and queries
  -> Domain and infrastructure
  -> MongoDB
```

Detailed component responsibilities will be recorded as each vertical slice is implemented.

The Application layer owns persistence and time abstractions. Infrastructure supplies their runtime implementations, keeping command handlers testable and independent of MongoDB and the system clock.

## Persistence boundary

Application handlers depend on the public `ITodoRepository` abstraction. Infrastructure registers `MongoTodoRepository` as its implementation:

```text
Application handler
  -> ITodoRepository
  -> MongoTodoRepository
  -> IMongoDatabase / IMongoCollection<TodoDocument>
  -> MongoDB
```

`TodoDocument`, its serializer, and its mapper are internal Infrastructure details. They are not exposed to Application or test projects. Repository integration tests exercise the public `ITodoRepository` contract and inspect raw BSON only when the persisted representation matters.

A separate `MongoDbContext` wrapper is intentionally not used. With one database and one collection it only duplicated `IMongoDatabase.GetCollection`; the repository owns collection access directly.

Simultaneous-write race coverage and complete optimistic-concurrency verification are deferred to the dedicated concurrency step.
